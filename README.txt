sshkey2sslkey - convert an ssh public key (dsa or rsa) to an openssl-format key file

For example, you could use this to encrypt something to someone's public rsa
ssh key, so you don't have to separately have them generate a key pair.

Also, just because I was messing about and wanted to understand more about RSA
and DSA keys in openssl and ssh.
